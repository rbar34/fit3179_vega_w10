    <h1>Asylum Seekers, Immigrants and Foreign Born Population</h1>
    <h2>Where do Asylum Seekers Come From and Who Takes their Fair Share?</h2>
    <p>
        Asylum seekers are people who leave their home countries, but whose refugee status has not been
        determined
        yet.
        A person can become an asylum seeker by leaving their home country if it is no longer safe for them to
        live
        there.
        Countries can become inhospitable for their citizens for a range of reasons including war, corruption,
        extreme
        poverty, persecution or climate crises.

                The OECD countries represented in the emoji scatterplot below are some of the countries who absorb
                asylum
                seeker who
                are found to be refugees.
                The scatterplot shows the trend of asylum seeker intake against OECD nation population, revealing that
                intake is
                proportional to the population of the destination country.
                Over time, all countries seem to increase their asylum seeker intake.
                There are a few outlier countries who accept more than the average number of asylum seekers per
                population
                like
                Luxembourg ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡º and Norway ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´.

                The rule map below shows the countries from which asylum seekers were accepted as refugees into
                Australia in
                2019.
                By hovering over the countries where the rules originate, we can see the number of refugees who left
                from
                there to
                live in Australia.
                The slider filters out rules from countries where the number of refugees resettled in Australia is lower
                than value
                selected.

    <h2>What is the Proportion of Foreign Born Citizens in OECD Nations?</h2>
    <p>
        Foreign-born citizens are often just economic immigrants and not resettled refugees.
        The choropleth maps below give an indication of the ethnic diversity of each state, territory, region or
        country.
        The scales the three maps are the same so comparisons can be made between them.

                The United States and Canada have accommodated several waves of immigration.
                Their most diverse states are California and Ontario.

                Europe is comprised of several non-OECD nations which is why this graph shows missing data.
                The most diverse country in Europe is Luxembourg with nearly 45% foreign-born population.

                Australia is regarded as a multi-cultural country, with most states having a higher foreign-born
                population than
                those in North America and Europe.
                West Australia has the highest proportion of foreign born population here.

    <h2>How Many Asylum Seekers did each OECD Nation Absorb and what was their Nation of Origin?</h2>
    <p>
        Here we can see the number of asylum seekers that each OECD nation absorbed over the period of 2000 - 2020.
        German's lead can be explained by the number of refugees that it accepted during ISIS's crusade over Syria.

        accepted.
